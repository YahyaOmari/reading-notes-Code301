# CSS Layout - float and clear

- The CSS float property specifies how an element should float.

- The CSS clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.

### Example how to use float .. 

1. fload:right; --> Will float the content/image to right.

2. fload:left; --> Will float the content/image to left.

3. float: none; --> Content/image will be displayed just where it occurs in the text.
