# REST API

## What is RESET API?
- A REST API is easily accessing web services without having excess processing. Whenever a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource. Actually we use this everyday, in Youtube and Google for example.

## HTTP request methods ..

- GET

The *GET* method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

- HEAD


The *HEAD* method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.

- POST

The *POST* method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

- PUT

The *PUT* method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

- DELETE

The *DELETE* method deletes the specified resource.

- CONNECT

The *CONNECT* method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
